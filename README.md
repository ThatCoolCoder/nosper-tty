# Nosper-TTY

Powerful terminal calculator using [Nosper Engine](https://github.com/ThatCoolCoder/nosper-engine).

## Installation

Node.js needs to be installed as `node`.

1. Download/clone the git repo (remember to use `--recurse-submodules` flag) - by only using stable versions of Nosper Engine, this project is stable enough to not need a proper release scheme.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the repo and run `npm install` to get dependencies
3. Add `path/to/nosper-tty/bin/` to your PATH environment variable.

The calculator can then be run as `nosper-tty`.
